This **Book Share** prototype represents a complete book rental application experience. It allows users to sign up or log in, explore a wide range of books across different genres, and view detailed information about each title, including author, price, and availability. Users can add books to their basket, enter delivery details, and choose a preferred payment method to place an order. The interface features a clean, user-friendly design with smooth navigation, making the overall flow—from browsing to checkout—feel realistic and engaging.
